# A fully featured Todo App

The previous app was too easy for all the models, so I iterated on the prompt until I came up with a more detailed prompt.

<!-- truncate -->

```markdown title="App Prompt"
Build a todo app.

Each todo item should have the following properties:
- content
- status (todo, in progress, complete)
- due date (optional)
- created date, started date (when it was marked as in progress), completed date (when it was marked as complete)
- tags (optional)
- priority (optional)

The app should have the following features:
 - You should be able to see the list of todos.
 - You should be able to add a todo, delete a todo and update a todo.
 - You should be able to mark a todo as complete.
 - You should be able to filter the todos by tags, status, priority, due date, including combinations of these filters.
 - You should be able to sort the todos by due date, created date, started date, completed date, priority, status.
 - You should be able to search for a todo by content.
```

Claude-3-5-sonnet mostly doesn't break a sweat, though we do have to fix a type error to get a production build.
